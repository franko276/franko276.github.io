# Favorite Labs

Lab 11 part 2

Lab 11 part 2 was really enjoyable because what we had to do is make a hi-lo 
and where you enter a list of numbers to guess the secret number, and they tell 
you if it’s high or low, what made this  lab really enjoyable was using the random 
number generator from 1-10 and learning how it works and how it can be implemented in projects

Lab 8 part 2

What I liked about lab 8 part 2 was the loops and combining strings with loops, which 
ended up being a big triangle when running. I found loops interesting to use because it was a variable 
that was being added or subtracted constantly until it reached a certain point to stop it. Then when I 
ran the test it counted how many lines, dashes, and bars that were added.

Lab 6 part 2

Lab 6 part 2 was really good because that's where we learned how to convert the variables to strings, 
and ended getting the word for the card, also using a if statement to determine the A card to be a 1 or 
11, Also have to make if statements to determine the face, number and if it’s a ace card and add the points 
together to get your score.
